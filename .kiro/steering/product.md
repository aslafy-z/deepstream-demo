# Product Overview

This is a real-time RTSP object detection system built on NVIDIA DeepStream that processes video streams using AI models, analyzes object behaviors, and generates events based on configurable criteria.

## Key Features

- Real-time RTSP video stream processing with GPU acceleration
- AI-powered object detection using ONNX/TensorRT models via DeepStream
- Object tracking with persistent IDs across frames
- Behavior analysis (object appearance, static detection, movement)
- Multi-protocol event delivery (HTTP POST, MQTT)
- Annotated video re-streaming with detection overlays
- Containerized deployment with GPU support
- Hot-reloadable YAML configuration

## Target Use Cases

- Security monitoring and surveillance
- Abandoned object detection
- Real-time activity monitoring
- Integration with existing monitoring systems
