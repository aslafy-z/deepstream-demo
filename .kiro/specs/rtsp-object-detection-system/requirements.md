# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a real-time RTSP object detection system built on NVIDIA DeepStream that processes video streams using AI models, analyzes object behaviors, and generates events based on configurable criteria. The system will be containerized, GPU-accelerated, and capable of re-streaming annotated video with minimal latency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to process RTSP video streams in real-time, so that I can monitor live camera feeds with AI-powered object detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an RTSP stream URL is provided THEN the system SHALL decode and process the video stream in real-time
2. WHEN the video stream is received THEN the system SHALL maintain continuous processing without frame drops under normal conditions
3. IF the RTSP stream becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and log the disconnection event
4. WHEN processing video frames THEN the system SHALL maintain frame rate compatibility with the source stream

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use custom ONNX or TensorRT models for object detection through DeepStream, so that I can deploy domain-specific detection capabilities with optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ONNX model file is provided THEN the system SHALL load it using DeepStream's nvinfer plugin
2. WHEN a TensorRT model file is provided THEN the system SHALL load and execute it through DeepStream's inference engine
3. WHEN object detection is performed THEN the system SHALL return bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels via DeepStream metadata
4. IF GPU memory is insufficient THEN the system SHALL report an error through DeepStream's error handling
5. WHEN multiple objects are detected in a frame THEN the system SHALL process all detected objects using DeepStream's batching capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want objects to be tracked with consistent IDs across frames using DeepStream's tracking capabilities, so that I can monitor individual object behaviors over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an object is first detected THEN the system SHALL assign a unique tracking ID using DeepStream's nvtracker plugin
2. WHEN the same object appears in subsequent frames THEN the system SHALL maintain the same tracking ID through DeepStream's tracking algorithms
3. WHEN an object leaves the frame and returns THEN the system SHALL attempt to reassign the previous tracking ID using DeepStream's re-identification features
4. WHEN tracking fails for an object THEN the system SHALL assign a new tracking ID and log the tracking loss through DeepStream metadata
5. WHEN configuring tracking THEN the system SHALL support DeepStream's tracking configuration parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring operator, I want to detect when objects appear in the camera field of view, so that I can be alerted to new activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new object enters the detection area THEN the system SHALL generate an "object_appeared" event
2. WHEN an object appearance event is generated THEN the system SHALL include object class, tracking ID, and timestamp
3. WHEN multiple objects appear simultaneously THEN the system SHALL generate separate events for each object
4. IF an object briefly disappears and reappears THEN the system SHALL apply configurable debouncing logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want to detect when objects remain stationary for extended periods, so that I can identify potential security concerns or abandoned items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an object remains in the same position for more than X seconds THEN the system SHALL generate an "object_static" event
2. WHEN calculating object movement THEN the system SHALL use configurable position tolerance thresholds
3. WHEN an object becomes static THEN the system SHALL include duration, position, and object details in the event
4. WHEN a static object starts moving again THEN the system SHALL generate an "object_moving" event
5. IF the static duration threshold is configurable THEN the system SHALL allow runtime configuration updates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want events to be sent via multiple messaging protocols, so that I can integrate with existing monitoring systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is generated THEN the system SHALL format it as structured JSON
2. WHEN HTTP POST is configured THEN the system SHALL send events to the specified endpoint
3. WHEN MQTT is configured THEN the system SHALL publish events to the specified topic
4. IF event delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN multiple delivery methods are configured THEN the system SHALL send events to all configured endpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a monitoring operator, I want to view annotated video streams with detection overlays, so that I can visually verify system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN objects are detected THEN the system SHALL overlay bounding boxes on the video stream
2. WHEN displaying annotations THEN the system SHALL show object class labels and tracking IDs
3. WHEN re-streaming video THEN the system SHALL support RTSP, UDP, and HLS output formats
4. WHEN annotations are displayed THEN the system SHALL use configurable colors and styles
5. IF no objects are detected THEN the system SHALL stream the original video without annotations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to be built using DeepStream's plugin-based pipeline architecture, so that I can leverage optimized video processing and AI inference capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the processing pipeline THEN the system SHALL use DeepStream's GStreamer-based plugin architecture
2. WHEN processing video THEN the system SHALL utilize DeepStream plugins including uridecodebin, nvstreammux, nvinfer, nvtracker, and nvvideoconvert
3. WHEN implementing custom logic THEN the system SHALL use DeepStream's probe functions and metadata APIs
4. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL implement custom DeepStream message handlers
5. IF pipeline errors occur THEN the system SHALL use DeepStream's error handling and bus message system

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to run in a containerized environment, so that I can deploy it consistently across different hardware platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL run in a Docker container with GPU access and DeepStream runtime
2. WHEN running on NVIDIA Jetson devices THEN the system SHALL utilize hardware acceleration through DeepStream
3. WHEN running on desktop GPUs THEN the system SHALL support CUDA and TensorRT optimization via DeepStream
4. IF insufficient GPU resources are available THEN the system SHALL report resource requirements and fail gracefully

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want configurable behavior through configuration files, so that I can adapt the system to different use cases without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from YAML or JSON files
2. WHEN configuration includes detection thresholds THEN the system SHALL apply them to object detection
3. WHEN configuration includes timing parameters THEN the system SHALL use them for behavior analysis
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL report specific validation errors
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without restart

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a storage administrator, I want the option to save only frames with detections, so that I can optimize storage usage and focus on relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detection-only mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL only output frames containing detected objects
2. WHEN no objects are detected THEN the system SHALL skip frame output in detection-only mode
3. WHEN saving frames THEN the system SHALL maintain timestamp accuracy for saved content
4. IF detection-only mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL output all frames regardless of detection status
